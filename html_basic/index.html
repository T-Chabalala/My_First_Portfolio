  <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
  <p>This is a basic HTML page built to demonstrate the structure of a webpage using headings, paragraphs, and images.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am an IT student specializing in cybersecurity and front-end development. I enjoy learning new technologies and building creative solutions.</p>

  <h3>My Journey</h3>
  <p>From setting up my first HTML page to learning Linux and Network+, Iâ€™m constantly growing my skill set through practice and bootcamps.</p>

  <p>This project is part of my learning path at ALX Africa and FNB Academy, where I apply my knowledge to real-world tasks and portfolio work.</p>
